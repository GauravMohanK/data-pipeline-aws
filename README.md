# 🛠️ Data Pipeline Project

A modular and production-ready data pipeline built with **Python** that:

- 📤 Extracts data from **MySQL**
- ☁️ Stages it in **Amazon S3**
- 🧱 Loads it into **Amazon Redshift**

Supports both **full loads** and **incremental loads**, and is structured for clarity and maintainability.
